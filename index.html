        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Hanah Bahamoud, and I have a passion for continuous learning. My time studying in Canada significantly improved my communication skills and ability to collaborate within diverse teams. While my academic focus was Tourism Management, I've since realized my interest in the tech industry. Initially, societal norms discouraged women from pursuing such careers, but I've overcome those barriers to pursue my aspirations. Following my return to London in 2020, I explored various job opportunities, but none felt right. Despite a personal setback with a divorce after relocating to Manchester in 2021, I've remained resilient. Towards the end of 2023, I decided to embrace a new challenge and learn Python. This decision has brought me immense joy, and I'm determined to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in the future.</p>

        <h3>Why Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Transitioning into a career as a web developer perfectly complements my professional strengths and personal aspirations. You see, I have this innate ability to articulate ideas efficiently and courteously, which has always served me well in deadline-driven environments and collaborative teams. It's not just about meeting deadlines; it's about thriving under pressure and continuously striving for both organizational objectives and personal growth. Now, embracing web development, it's like unlocking a whole new realm where I can put these skills to work while delving deeper into technology. I'm excited about actively expanding my expertise in this field because I firmly believe that staying proactive in pursuing knowledge in tech is the key to keeping up with the ever-evolving landscape of software development. It's about aligning seamlessly with industry trends and ensuring that my skills remain at the forefront.</p>
